LibRJ.Cities
============
This library provides a simple EF-based model for dealing with cities, state/provinces or other regions within a country, and countries.  Information can be pulled in from the [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/) project.

## Installing
Some day, there will be a NuGet package available. Until then, clone and build it by hand. The `LibRJ.Cities.GeoNames` library is optional, and contains logic required to import data from GeoNames.
